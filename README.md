MS-tang is a Mustang-inspired car showcase platform developed using React.js, JavaScript, and CSS. The project emphasizes reusable components to ensure modularity and maintainability, while a scalable front-end architecture enhances performance. I designed and implemented responsive layouts and interactive UI elements to deliver an engaging user experience across devices. The platform focuses on clean code practices, efficient state management, and optimal performance for long-term scalability.
